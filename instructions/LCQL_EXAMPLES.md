## üìñ LCQL Query Structure

<!-- Understanding the fundamental structure of LCQL queries -->

### Basic Structure
```
<time_range> | <platform_filter> | <event_types> | <filter_conditions> | <output_fields>
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Event Type Positioning
**Event types (NEW_PROCESS, YARA_DETECTION, NETWORK_CONNECTIONS, etc.) MUST be placed in the 3rd position of the query, NOT in the filter conditions (4th position).**

#### ‚úÖ CORRECT Examples:
```lcql
-1h | * | YARA_DETECTION | / exists
-24h | * | NEW_PROCESS NETWORK_CONNECTIONS | event/FILE_PATH contains "suspicious"
-168h | plat == windows | CODE_IDENTITY YARA_DETECTION | / exists
```

#### ‚ùå INCORRECT Examples:
```lcql
-1h | * | * | event_type == "YARA_DETECTION"  # WRONG - event type in filter
-24h | * | * | routing/event_type == "NEW_PROCESS"  # WRONG - event type in filter
```

### Time Ranges

#### Relative Time Formats (from current time)
- `-<number>m` - Minutes in the past (e.g., `-30m`, `-5m`)
- `-<number>h` - Hours in the past (e.g., `-1h`, `-24h`, `-168h`)

Common examples:
- `-5m` - Last 5 minutes
- `-30m` - Last 30 minutes
- `-1h` - Last hour
- `-6h` - Last 6 hours
- `-24h` - Last 24 hours (1 day)
- `-48h` - Last 48 hours (2 days)
- `-168h` - Last 168 hours (7 days)
- `-720h` - Last 720 hours (30 days)

#### Absolute Time Ranges
- Format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS to YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`
- Example: `2025-01-01 00:00:00 to 2025-01-02 00:00:00`

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Days (e.g., `-7d`, `-30d`) are NOT valid LCQL time selectors. Use hours (`h`) or minutes (`m`) for relative times, or absolute date-time ranges.

### Platform Filters
- `plat == windows` - Windows only
- `plat == linux` - Linux only
- `plat == macos` - macOS only
- `*` - All platforms

### Common Event Types
- `NEW_PROCESS` - Process creation
- `EXISTING_PROCESS` - Process discovery
- `NETWORK_CONNECTIONS` - Network activity
- `DNS_REQUEST` - DNS queries
- `WEL` - Windows Event Logs
- `CODE_IDENTITY` - Code signing info
- `FILE_CREATE` - File creation
- `FILE_DELETE` - File deletion
- `REGISTRY_CREATE` - Registry key creation

### Aggregation Functions
- `COUNT()` - Count occurrences
- `COUNT_UNIQUE()` - Count unique values
- `GROUP BY()` - Group results by fields
- `SUM()` - Sum numeric values
- `AVG()` - Average numeric values

## üí° Tips for Effective LCQL Queries

<!-- Best practices for writing efficient and effective queries -->

1. **Start with shorter time ranges** to test queries before expanding
2. **Use platform filters** to reduce noise and improve performance
3. **Combine event types** with space separation for OR logic
4. **Use GROUP BY** for statistical analysis and anomaly detection
5. **Alias fields** with `as` for cleaner output
6. **Test filters incrementally** - build complex queries step by step

## üîß Troubleshooting Failed LCQL Queries

### When queries return empty results:

1. **Verify event types exist**:
   ```lcql
   -1h | * | NEW_PROCESS EXISTING_PROCESS | event/* exists
   ```
   Use a very small limit (1-5) to check if events exist.

2. **Check available event types for a sensor**:
   ```lcql
   -1h | hostname contains "target-host" | * | / exists | 
   routing/event_type as EventType COUNT(EventType) as Count 
   GROUP BY(EventType)
   ```

3. **Remove filters progressively**:
   - Start broad: `-1h | * | EVENT_TYPE | event/* exists`
   - Add platform: `-1h | plat == windows | EVENT_TYPE | event/* exists`
   - Add hostname: `-1h | hostname contains "server" | EVENT_TYPE | event/* exists`
   - Add field filters last

4. **Check process creation times**:
   - Processes may have been created days/weeks ago
   - Use `get_processes(sid)` to check CREATION_TIME field
   - If creation is outside 7-day window, query recent activity instead

5. **Array field notation**:
   - NETWORK_ACTIVITY is an array: use `event/NETWORK_ACTIVITY/*/DESTINATION/IP_ADDRESS`
   - Not: `event/NETWORK_ACTIVITY/DESTINATION/IP_ADDRESS`

6. **Common pitfalls**:
   - Process created before query window (check CREATION_TIME in get_processes)
   - Wrong field paths (verify against SAMPLE_EVENTS.md)
   - Array fields need `*/` notation for traversal
   - Missing data for time range (use get_time_when_sensor_has_data)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Query Validation and Event Structure

**NEVER assume that an initial query with no results means the events don't exist.** Your query syntax or field paths may be incorrect.

### Query Validation Workflow

1. **First, validate event existence** with a simple query:
   ```lcql
   -1h | * | EVENT_TYPE | event/* exists
   ```
   Use a very small limit (5-10) to check if events exist and examine their structure.

2. **Check organization-specific event schemas**:
   ```python
   # Single event type
   get_event_schema(name="NEW_PROCESS")
   
   # Multiple event types at once
   get_event_schemas_batch(event_names=["NEW_PROCESS", "YARA_DETECTION", "DNS_REQUEST"])
   ```
   Note: Some event types may show empty schemas but still contain data.

3. **Reference sample events** in this repository:
   - Check `@instructions/SAMPLE_EVENTS.md` for detailed event structures
   - Look for the specific event type to understand field paths
   - Pay attention to nested structures and array fields

4. **Examine the event structure** before crafting complex queries:
   - Look at the raw event data to understand field paths
   - Check nested structures (e.g., `event/EVENTS/*/SOURCE/FILE_PATH`)
   - Note which fields are arrays vs single values

5. **Use available resources** before writing complex queries:
   - Check LCQL examples in this project for similar queries
   - Use the `generate_lcql_query()` tool for AI assistance
   - Reference `SAMPLE_EVENTS.md` for event structures
   - Use `get_event_schema()` to check org-specific schemas

6. **Build incrementally**:
   - Start with `event/* exists` to see raw data
   - Add one filter at a time
   - Test each addition before proceeding

### Example: Finding SENSITIVE_PROCESS_ACCESS Events

```lcql
# Step 1: Check if events exist
-168h | * | SENSITIVE_PROCESS_ACCESS | event/* exists

# Step 2: Examine structure to find source process path  
-168h | * | SENSITIVE_PROCESS_ACCESS | event/* exists | event/EVENTS as Events

# Step 3: Build the final query based on discovered structure
-168h | * | SENSITIVE_PROCESS_ACCESS | event/* exists | 
event/*/event/SOURCE/FILE_PATH as source_process 
COUNT(event) as access_count 
GROUP BY(source_process)
```

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ‚ùå Assuming field paths without checking structure
- ‚ùå Giving up when first query returns no results
- ‚ùå Writing complex queries without understanding event schema
- ‚ùå Assuming empty schemas mean no events exist (some events have empty schemas but still contain data)
- ‚ùå **Using undocumented LCQL operators** - NEVER use HAVING, LIMIT, WHERE, or other SQL-like operators unless explicitly shown in LCQL examples
- ‚úÖ Always validate event existence first with `event/* exists`
- ‚úÖ Check org-specific schemas with `get_event_schema()` tools
- ‚úÖ Reference `SAMPLE_EVENTS.md` for event structure examples
- ‚úÖ Use `generate_lcql_query()` for AI-assisted query generation
- ‚úÖ Build queries incrementally, testing each step
- ‚úÖ **Only use documented LCQL syntax** - When in doubt, use generate_lcql_query() to verify proper syntax
