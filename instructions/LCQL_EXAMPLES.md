## üíª Process Analysis

<!-- Queries for analyzing process behavior and relationships -->

### Examine rundll32.exe executions with command line analysis
```lcql
-12h | plat == windows | NEW_PROCESS | event/PARENT/FILE_PATH contains "rundll32.exe" | event/PARENT/FILE_PATH as parent event/FILE_PATH as child event/COMMAND_LINE as commandline
```

### Find rundll32 executions missing DLL arguments (suspicious)
```lcql
-6h | plat==windows | NEW_PROCESS EXISTING_PROCESS | event/FILE_PATH contains "rundll32.exe" AND event/COMMAND_LINE not contains ".dll" | ts as Timestamp event/FILE_PATH as Path event/COMMAND_LINE as CommandLine
```

### Analyze network activity by specific process
```lcql
-6h | plat==windows | NETWORK_CONNECTIONS | event/FILE_PATH contains "rundll32.exe" | event/FILE_PATH event/NETWORK_ACTIVITY/DESTINATION/IP_ADDRESS as dest_ip event/NETWORK_ACTIVITY/DESTINATION/PORT as dest_port
```

### Stack child processes by parent
```lcql
-12h | plat == windows | NEW_PROCESS | event/PARENT/FILE_PATH contains "cmd.exe" | event/PARENT/FILE_PATH as parent event/FILE_PATH as child COUNT_UNIQUE(event) as count GROUP BY(parent child)
```

### Find processes with specific base64 strings in command line
```lcql
-1h | plat == windows | NEW_PROCESS EXISTING_PROCESS | event/COMMAND_LINE contains "RwBlAHQALQBQAHIAbwBjAGUAcwBzACAATQBzAE0AcABFAG4AZwAsAHMAeQBzAG0AbwBuACoA" | event/FILE_PATH as path event/COMMAND_LINE as cli routing/hostname as host
```

### Same query with counting
```lcql
-1h | plat == windows | NEW_PROCESS EXISTING_PROCESS | event/COMMAND_LINE contains "RwBlAHQALQBQAHIAbwBjAGUAcwBzACAATQBzAE0AcABFAG4AZwAsAHMAeQBzAG0AbwBuACoA" | event/FILE_PATH as path event/COMMAND_LINE as cli routing/hostname as host COUNT(cli) as Count GROUP BY(path cli host)
```

## üîê Authentication and Logon Analysis

<!-- Monitor authentication events for anomalies -->

### Analyze failed logons
```lcql
-1h | plat==windows | WEL | event/EVENT/System/EventID is '4625' | event/EVENT/EventData/IpAddress as SrcIP event/EVENT/EventData/LogonType as LogonType event/EVENT/EventData/TargetUserName as Username event/EVENT/EventData/WorkstationName as SrcHostname
```

### Failed logons grouped
```lcql
-1h | plat==windows | WEL | event/EVENT/System/EventID is '4625' | event/EVENT/EventData/IpAddress as SrcIP event/EVENT/EventData/LogonType as LogonType event/EVENT/EventData/TargetUserName as Username event/EVENT/EventData/WorkstationName as SrcHostname GROUP BY(LogonType Username SrcHostname SrcIP)
```

### Successful logons by specific type (Type 10 = RemoteInteractive/RDP)
```lcql
-24h | plat == windows | WEL | event/EVENT/System/EventID == "4624" AND event/EVENT/EventData/LogonType == "10"
```

### Stack successful logons by user and type
```lcql
-24h | plat == windows | WEL | event/EVENT/System/EventID == "4624" | event/EVENT/EventData/LogonType AS LogonType event/EVENT/EventData/TargetUserName as UserName COUNT_UNIQUE(event) as Count GROUP BY(UserName LogonType)
```

## ‚úÖ Code Integrity and Signing

<!-- Identify unsigned or suspicious binaries -->

### Find unsigned binaries
```lcql
-24h | plat == windows | CODE_IDENTITY | event/SIGNATURE/FILE_IS_SIGNED == 0 | event/FILE_PATH as Path event/HASH as Hash event/ORIGINAL_FILE_NAME as OriginalFileName COUNT_UNIQUE(Hash) as Count GROUP BY(Path Hash OriginalFileName)
```

## üåê Network Analysis

<!-- Analyze network connections and DNS queries -->

### DNS queries for specific domain
```lcql
-6h | * | DNS_REQUEST | event/DOMAIN_NAME contains "suspicious-domain" | event/ts as Timestamp event/DOMAIN_NAME as Query event/IP_ADDRESS as Response routing/hostname as Host
```

### Count unique hosts querying specific domain
```lcql
-6h | * | DNS_REQUEST | event/DOMAIN_NAME contains "suspicious-domain" | event/DOMAIN_NAME as dns COUNT_UNIQUE(routing/hostname) as hostcount GROUP BY(dns)
```

### Stack CNAME records (DNS_TYPE 5)
```lcql
-24h | * | DNS_REQUEST | event/DNS_TYPE == 5 | event/DOMAIN_NAME AS DomainName COUNT(DomainName) as count GROUP BY(DomainName)
```

### Network connections to specific IP
```lcql
-6h | * | NETWORK_CONNECTIONS| event/NETWORK_ACTIVITY/DESTINATION/IP_ADDRESS is "203.0.113.100" | event/FILE_PATH as path routing/hostname as host COUNT(path) as Count GROUP BY(path host)
```

### Network connections by specific process
```lcql
-6h | plat==windows | NETWORK_CONNECTIONS | event/FILE_PATH contains "rundll32.exe" | event/FILE_PATH event/NETWORK_ACTIVITY/DESTINATION/IP_ADDRESS as dest_ip event/NETWORK_ACTIVITY/DESTINATION/PORT as dest_port
```

## üîó Combined Analysis Examples

<!-- Complex queries combining multiple event types -->

### Suspicious rundll32 with missing DLL and hostname context
```lcql
-6h | plat==windows | NEW_PROCESS EXISTING_PROCESS | event/FILE_PATH contains "rundll32.exe" AND event/COMMAND_LINE not contains ".dll" | ts as Timestamp event/FILE_PATH as Path event/COMMAND_LINE as CommandLine routing/hostname as Hostname
```

## üìñ LCQL Query Structure

<!-- Understanding the fundamental structure of LCQL queries -->

### Basic Structure
```
<time_range> | <platform_filter> | <event_types> | <filter_conditions> | <output_fields>
```

### Time Ranges
- `-1h` - Last hour
- `-6h` - Last 6 hours
- `-12h` - Last 12 hours
- `-24h` - Last 24 hours
- `-7d` - Last 7 days

### Platform Filters
- `plat == windows` - Windows only
- `plat == linux` - Linux only
- `plat == macos` - macOS only
- `*` - All platforms

### Common Event Types
- `NEW_PROCESS` - Process creation
- `EXISTING_PROCESS` - Process discovery
- `NETWORK_CONNECTIONS` - Network activity
- `DNS_REQUEST` - DNS queries
- `WEL` - Windows Event Logs
- `CODE_IDENTITY` - Code signing info
- `FILE_CREATE` - File creation
- `FILE_DELETE` - File deletion
- `REGISTRY_CREATE` - Registry key creation

### Aggregation Functions
- `COUNT()` - Count occurrences
- `COUNT_UNIQUE()` - Count unique values
- `GROUP BY()` - Group results by fields
- `SUM()` - Sum numeric values
- `AVG()` - Average numeric values

## üí° Tips for Effective LCQL Queries

<!-- Best practices for writing efficient and effective queries -->

1. **Start with shorter time ranges** to test queries before expanding
2. **Use platform filters** to reduce noise and improve performance
3. **Combine event types** with space separation for OR logic
4. **Use GROUP BY** for statistical analysis and anomaly detection
5. **Alias fields** with `as` for cleaner output
6. **Test filters incrementally** - build complex queries step by step
